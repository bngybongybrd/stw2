Description: This project is our Microsoft Imagine Cup Junior project which is a web application which makes use of our own Machine Learning AI as well as Open AI to calculate the risk score of a patient of getting heart and cardiovascular diseases based on the users input of age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking status. The Machine Learning calculates the risk score and the Open AI uses the risk score and the user's input to generate a personalised recommendation plan for the user to improve his/her health (Shown below).

Languages used for this Project: Python, HTML, CSS, SQL and Javascript

Design considerations:
- User friendly
- Recommendations given by AI should be consistent, and in similar format
- Other consideration are in the google slide

Features that should be/needs to be added:
- Loading screen when api is getting the response
- Option to allow user to go directly to results page to see past results/recommendation or enter a new input
